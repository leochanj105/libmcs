You are fixing the transpiled Rust code to match the original C behavior.

- Original C code: /home/leochanj/Desktop/libmcs/libm/
- Transpiled Rust code: __RUST_DIR__/

Read the goal files provided in the context. Each goal names a specific function
and includes the C source file path. Do NOT read all source files — only read
the files named in the goals.

For each goal:
1. Read the C source file listed in the goal.
2. Read the corresponding Rust source (if it exists).
3. Fix the Rust code:
   - Missing function: implement it by translating the C code. Add a
     `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"` export in lib.rs.
   - Wrong output: find the bug and fix it.
   - Crash: find the panic and fix it.
   - Compile error: fix the syntax/type error.

## Rules
- Reproduce the C behavior exactly — output must match bitwise.
- Do NOT add `extern "C"` declarations linking back to C code.
- Do NOT add `#![no_std]`. Keep `crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib"]`.
